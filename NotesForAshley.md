This is Austin Neal typing this. I collaborated with Marlesha Ellis. Primary form of communication was over discord where we communicated and traded our ideas and inputs. I primarily did number 1, and deserving of credit Marlehsa primarily did problems 2 and 3.
I made small adjustments and adding node a too her code but overall she did the grunt work on them. The Github is a bit unorganized as it doesnt put itself in submission order but appears to be alphabetical and many were overwritten because they had the same name.

Warning: HW6 NUM 2.py is not the final file its at the top because of alphabetical order but it is an earlier file.
